## The Core Libraries
The Core Libraries are a suite of C# tools offering a unique, easy to use, correct-by-construction, approach to
race-free concurrent programming.  Inspired by Midori, E-lang and Erlang, the Core is a Promise-based, single-threaded 
software-isolated process (Sip) model loosely conforming to Tony Hoarse's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
formalism.
