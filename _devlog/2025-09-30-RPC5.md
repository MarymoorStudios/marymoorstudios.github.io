# RPC Part 5: Channel Lifetime
--------

## Intro
In the [previous post][devlog-post5] we learned about capabilities and Capability Exchange.  We examined how capablities
provide elegant, powerful, and highly efficient mechanisms for interacting with remote distributed objects and their
state.  Finally, we touched on some of the ways in which capabilities can be used to build secure systems.  In this post
we will look at streaming sequences which provide a model for dealing with data whose length is very large (or even
infinite).

## Motivating Example
Consider a multiplayer game architecture from the highest level.  Abstractly, it might consist of a game server and some
number of game clients.  The game server orchestrates the game.  Each of the clients collects input from one of the
players and passes it to the game server.  The game server combines all of the inputs, updates the active state of the
game, and communicates game state changes to the clients.  Finally, each client updates its own display to reflect the
current state of the game.  This process continues in a loop indefinitely until the game server determines (according to
the rules of the game) that the game is over.


## Conclusion
In this post we talked about streaming sequences including `Sequence<T>` and `Bytes`.  We examined some of the issues
that streaming solves including memory limitations, network latency, traffic minimization, flow control, and
backpressure.  Lastly, we looked at some unique characterisitcs of the [Promise RPC][promise-rpc] library's
implementation of streaming sequences.

This is Part 4 of our look at the [MSC][MSC] RPC system.  In the next and final part, we'll look at channel lifetime,
aborts and cancellation.  Until next time, code on!
