# RPC Part 5: Session Lifetime
--------

## Intro
In the [previous post][devlog-post6] we learned about Streaming Sequences and Streams.  We examined some of the issues
that streaming solves including memory limitations, network latency, traffic minimization, flow control, and
backpressure.  In this post, the last in this series focused on the [MSC][MSC] RPC system, we will think a little about
session lifetime and what impact that has on eventual values.

## Session Lifecycle
Back in the post [RPC Part 3: Capability Exchange][devlog-post5] we introduced the [Root Capability][define-root].


## Conclusion
In this post we talked about streaming sequences including `Sequence<T>` and `Bytes`.  We examined some of the issues
that streaming solves including memory limitations, network latency, traffic minimization, flow control, and
backpressure.  Lastly, we looked at some unique characterisitcs of the [Promise RPC][promise-rpc] library's
implementation of streaming sequences.

This is Part 4 of our look at the [MSC][MSC] RPC system.  In the next and final part, we'll look at channel lifetime,
aborts and cancellation.  Until next time, code on!
