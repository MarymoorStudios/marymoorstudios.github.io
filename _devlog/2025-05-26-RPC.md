# RPC
--------

## Intro

In the previous post I discussed ordering, concurrency, and interleavings.  In this next post I'll delve into many of
the design goals for the RPC package that forms the backbone for all our distributed systems built on the [MSC (Marymoor
Studios Core libraries)][MSC].


## Design Goals

* Location Independence
* Interface ordering
* Capability-based security
  * Lots of literature on this subject.
	* Game Services
		* Versioning control.
		* Game Launcher
		* Game Owner
		* Game Player
				* Player1
				* Player2
