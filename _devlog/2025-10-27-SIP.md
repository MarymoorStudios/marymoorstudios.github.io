# SIP: Software Isolated Process
--------

## Intro
In the [previous post][devlog-post6] we learned about Sequences and Streams.  We examined some of the issues that
streaming solves including memory limitations, network latency, traffic minimization, flow control, and backpressure. In
this post, the last in this series focused on the [MSC][MSC] RPC system, we will talk a little about Sessions, session
lifetime and what impact session termination has on eventual values.

Back in the post [RPC Part 3: Capability Exchange][devlog-post5] we introduced the concept of the [Root
Capability][define-root].  The root was the _first_ capability that we acquired.  We observed that the root was received
"when successfully initiating a new connected session".  But what does that mean?  What is a session?  How do we connect
one?  How long does it last?  What happens when the connection is terminated?  We will try to answer these questions in
this post.

## Transport vs. Session
Many message passing systems, including [Promise RPC][promise-rpc], are designed around two different layers of
abstraction during point-to-point communication.  Each is responsible for a different aspect of the overall function.

* **Transport Layer:**  
  The transport layer defines the mechanics of physically moving data between two endpoints.  It is usually also
  responsible for data ordering, reliability and integrity.

* **Session Layer:**  
  The session layer defines the logical protocol for communication.  It is responsible for designating the structure of
  messages, the format of message serialization, and the semantics of message exchange.  This layer is also responsible
  for authentication, versioning, and configuration negotiations.


## Conclusion
In this post we talked about transports and sessions.  We examined how sessions are created and what kinds information
are exchanged during session initiation.  We looked at various forms of session grouping and lifetime scoping.  Lastly,
we looked at session termination and how that impacts eventual values that span sessions.

This is the last post in our series focused on the [MSC][MSC] RPC system.  Until next time, code on!
