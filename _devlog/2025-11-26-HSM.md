# HSM: Hierarchical State Machine
--------

## Intro
In several previous posts I've mentioned SIPs in passing without ever really getting into what they are.  In this
article I'd like to provide a little more detail about what I mean by the term **SIP** and why I like them (and why
you should too).

SIP is an acronym for **Software Isolated Process**.  I usually use the term _SIP_ instead of _Process_ because the word
"Process" has become very overloaded in computing and can mean different things to different people.  To understand how
these terms have become so muddy, we'll have to take a trip down memory lane (bad pun intended).

## A Brief History of the Process
In the early days of computing, programs (aka jobs, or tasks) executed one at a time, sequentially on a single CPU.  The
CPU executed the instructions of the program in the order they were written.  The program had complete control over all
of the hardware including all memory and all IO devices.


## Conclusion
In this is post, we talked about the Software Isolated Process or SIP as a programming methodology that promotes
dissecting complex multithreaded programs into independent segments of logic and state which can be executed
sequentially, each with their own exclusive access to a block of isolated memory.

I hope you find good uses for your SIPs.  Until next time, code on!
